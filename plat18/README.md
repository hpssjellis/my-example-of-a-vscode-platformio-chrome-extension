ZIP Upload Feature - Summary

Changes Made

1\. mySidePanel.html

Updated:



File input now accepts .zip files instead of .json

Upload area text changed to "Drop model.zip here"

Model info display now shows file count (model.json + weight files)

Added JSZip library from CDN for client-side ZIP extraction



2\. mySidePanel.js

Updated:



myProcessModelFile() function now:



Accepts ZIP files only

Extracts ZIP using JSZip library

Finds model.json inside ZIP

Extracts all weight files referenced in weightsManifest

Validates all required files are present

Shows detailed status for each file found/missing

Packages everything as base64 for server transmission







Data Structure Sent to Server:

javascript{

  modelTopology: { /\* model.json content \*/ },

  weightFiles: {

    "group1-shard1of2.bin": "base64data...",

    "group1-shard2of2.bin": "base64data...",

    // ... more weight files

  },

  fileName: "model.zip"

}

3\. my-bridge-server.js

Updated:



myConvertTFJSToTFLite() function now:



Saves model.json

Iterates through all weight files and saves each one

Logs each weight file being saved

Python script can now find all weights in the directory







How to Use

Creating a Model ZIP File

Option 1: Manual ZIP Creation



Export your TensorFlow.js model (creates model.json + weight files)

Select all files (model.json + all .bin files)

Right-click → "Compress" or "Send to → Compressed folder"

Name it mymodel.zip



Example model folder:

my\_model/

├── model.json

├── group1-shard1of3.bin

├── group1-shard2of3.bin

└── group1-shard3of3.bin

Zip it:

bash# Linux/Mac

cd my\_model

zip -r ../mymodel.zip \*



\# Windows

\# Right-click folder → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder

Using the Extension



Open extension side panel

Go to "TFLite Converter" tab

Enter model name: my\_model

Drag and drop mymodel.zip OR click to browse

Extension will show:



   ✓ Found: model.json

   ✓ Found: group1-shard1of3.bin

   ✓ Found: group1-shard2of3.bin

   ✓ Found: group1-shard3of3.bin

   Files Found: 4 (model.json + 3 weights)



Click "Convert to TFLite"

Download the .tflite file when complete



What Happens Behind the Scenes



Client Side (Extension):



User drops ZIP file

JSZip extracts all files in browser memory

Finds model.json and parses it

Reads weightsManifest to see which weight files are needed

Searches ZIP for each weight file

Converts all files to base64

Sends everything to server as JSON





Server Side (Bridge):



Receives model.json + all weight files as base64

Creates temporary directory

Saves model.json

Saves each weight file with original filename

Python script loads model from directory (finds all files)

Converts to TFLite with quantization

Returns .tflite file as base64

Client downloads the file







Advantages of ZIP Approach

✅ Simple for users - Just zip the folder

✅ No file validation needed - Everything is included

✅ Works with any number of weight shards - Automatically handles 1, 5, 10+ files

✅ Preserves file structure - Works even if model.json is in a subfolder

✅ One upload operation - No multi-step process

✅ Browser-side extraction - No server-side zip handling needed

Testing

To test the feature:



Download a sample TensorFlow.js model

Zip the model folder

Upload via extension

Verify all files are detected

Convert and download .tflite file



Notes



JSZip library is loaded from CDN (no installation needed)

Maximum file size is 100MB (set in server JSON parser)

Weight files are stored with their original filenames

Python's tensorflowjs converter automatically finds all weight files in the directory

























PlatformIO \& TFLite Tools - Chrome Extension
A Chrome extension that provides two powerful development tools:

Arduino Code Compiler \& Flasher - Compile and upload Arduino code to boards via PlatformIO
TensorFlow.js to TFLite Converter - Convert TF.js models to TensorFlow Lite format

Both features work through a local Node.js bridge server that interfaces with PlatformIO CLI and Python/TensorFlow.

🎯 Tips \& Best Practices
Arduino Development

Always check the Serial Console for runtime output
Use Serial.begin(9600) in your setup for serial communication
Clear logs regularly to keep the interface clean
Save your code externally - the editor doesn't auto-save

TFLite Conversion

Model name will be used as the filename
Converted models are optimized with float16 quantization
Keep model files under 50MB for best performance
Test converted models on target hardware before deployment

Server Management

Keep the bridge server running while using the extension
Restart the server if you experience connection issues
Check server logs for detailed debugging information
Use npm run dev (with nodemon) for development
